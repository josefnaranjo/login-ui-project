A log-in app created using HTML and stylized using external CSS.
The requirements for this project were:

[x] A link to your repository must be submitted (and must be working).
[x] You must use an external stylesheet.
[x] The Login box must be centered on the screen and stay in the center of the screen even as you     resize the web browser window.
[x] You must use Flexbox.
[x] This should be relatively easily accomplished with Flexbox.
[x] The log-in box should have a minimum size, and the input fields or text in the box should not     leak out of the box.
[x] The log-in box should have box-shadow and rounded edges.
[x] The log-in box should have a username and password input field with placeholder text like in      the photo.
[x] If you can, please make sure the text entered into the password field is hidden (with     
    asterisks or circles).
[x] The log-in box should have a button.
